<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am a recent graduate from the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico with a GPA score of: 3.60/4.00. My simple goal right now is learn as much as i can, gaining new experiences and performing at my upmost best when it comes to coding. as far as coding experience goes, I have experience with the following programming languages: C++, VB.NET, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and python. i am also currently learning on how to code in certain game engines such as GODOT and Unreal Engine. My hope is that these skill that I've learned during my years in college will become useful in any of the jobs i enter.<br></p>
